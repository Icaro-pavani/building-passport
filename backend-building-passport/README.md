## :clipboard: Description

Building Passport is an APP that makes easier to invite people and guarantee their access in the condominium. Its only need to ask the condominium manager to register your data to the system and you'll be able to invite your guests and, after their confirmation, their entry will be guaranteed by a QRCode generated in the confirmation.
